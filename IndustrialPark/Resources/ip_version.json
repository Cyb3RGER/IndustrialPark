Some functions (such as using asset names instead of IDs and editing models and textures) are not available in this mode.\n* Asset list in Archive Editor now has columns with asset name, ID, type and size in bytes and allows sorting ascending or descending by any of the columns.\n* Adds asset editor: WIRE (used in Incredibles) which can import and export .OBJ files with splines for the \"wireframe models\". This function is still experimental.\n* Adds asset editor: JSP for JSPINFO. This function is still experimental.\n* Adds option: Hide Invisible Meshes. This will hide meshes which are set to be invisible in MODL and JSP assets.\n* Adds editing of Atomic Flags for both MODL and JSP assets. This allows you to set collision and visibility for individual meshes of the models.\n* Run Game (F5) now sets the boot level (in the sb.ini file) to the level of the currently opened HIP/HOPs (if multiple are open, the first one will be used).\n* Fixes adding new user templates in the User Template Manager\n* Attempted fix of converting UIFT asset between GC/XBOX\n* Removed \"Name Display Mode\" setting from Options\n* Randomizer: adds two new options (Invisible Level and Invisible Objects)\n"
