  "versionName": "\nPreview 58\n\n* Refresh Textures and Models (under Options): use this if models and textures don't show up properly after importing a HIP, textures or models, or after closing an archive.\n* Update References on Copy/Paste (toggleable under Options, defaults to active): when copying and pasting multiple assets, if they have references such as events to each other, the reference will be updated to point to the copy. This is not done for the following asset types: BSP, JSP, MODL, RWTX, SND, SNDS, SNDI and TEXT.\n* Adds shortcuts for Target Asset in Link Editor: Self (makes the event point to the sender asset) and +1 (adds 1 to the number at the end of the target asset name).\n* Ignore Mesh Colors: checkbox in the Import Models dialog. With this checked, IP will ignore unwanted mesh colors (usually set by DAE and FBX exporters, they end up making the models darker than they should be).\n* Updates asset format converter (editing an archive's PACK (to change the game/platform) or copying/pasting assets between archives of different formats) with the following asset types: ATBL, PARS, PARP, SHRP, SURF.\n* Adds support for importing custom textures for Scooby.\n* Fixes user or clipboard pasted templates of box triggers.\n* Updates asset editors: PARE, PARP, PKUP, BSP/JSP/MODL.\n* Adds skybox movement to Movement Preview.\n* Some settings (Use LODT for Rendering, Use PIPT for Rendering, Hide Invisible Meshes, Persistent Shinies, Update References on Copy/Paste and Hide Help in Asset Editors) are now saved in the global IP settings instead of project settings.\n"
