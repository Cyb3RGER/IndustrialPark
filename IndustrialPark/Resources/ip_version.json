  "versionName": "Preview 55:\n* PIPT rendering: allows rendering of models according to flags set in pipe info table (PIPT) asset. This feature is not perfect as Industrial Park's renderer and the game's are not the same.\n* Updated PIPT editor: allows editing of individual source and destination flags.\n* Updated gizmos: gizmos are sized according to screen position and not model. This keeps their size consistent and much easier to handle. Rotation and scale gizmos allow editing of multiple assets at once (but the transform origin is still local to each object).\n* Update for box triggers: new gizmo allows editing all 6 box coordinates (minimums and maximums) plus trigger pivot point. This allows for more precise placement of box triggers (specially with rotation). Maximums and minimums are also automatically set.\n* Includes BFBBAnimTools.ms under Resources/Scripts.\n* Auto updater on this version might not work for some users. In this case, please download manually from the web page.\n"
