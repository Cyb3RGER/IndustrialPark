  "versionName": "Preview 54:\n* Randomizer: improved compatibility for Linux (thanks Dark)\n* Randomizer: allows you to choose a backup files directory. When applying the randomizer, all files will be loaded from the backup but will overwrite your selected root directory; the backup files will be left untouched. You still have the option to apply it directly to the files, though.\n* Randomizer: saves your backup and files directories when closing and reloads them when opening.\n* Randomizer: new methods.\n* * Player Characters: Bus Stops in any level can switch you to any character (Patrick or Sandy). This will automatically turn on 'Unlock Characters'.\n* * Unlock Characters: Allows playing as Patrick and Sandy on every level. Enabling this will limit Enemies_Allow_Any_Type (enemies from other levels will not be used anymore) as both methods cannot be used together.\n* * BFBB: Player Switch (INI cheat): use arrow keys to switch characters.\n* * Open Teleport Boxes: All teleport boxes start opened.\n* * Disable Flythroughs: Disables level intro cutscenes.\n* * Restore Robot Laugh: restores the robot laugh sound which was removed from the GameCube version of the game.\n"
